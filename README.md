The elm terminal pacakge

**Note** This is for testing only, it is not intended to be used in production. And probably may not even compile with Elm 0.19.1.

Currently there is only one function `print` which prints a string to the terminal.

```elm
import Terminal

main =
  Terminal.print "Hello, World!"
```
